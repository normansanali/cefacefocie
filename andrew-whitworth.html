On December 12, 2010 Whitworth caught a one-yard touchdown pass from <a href=#>Carson Palmer</a> against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

In 2002, he started every game, and was recognized as a first-team Freshman All-American by The Sporting News and Football Writers Association. As a sophomore in 2003, he started all 14 games.

Whitworth helped the Bengals pile up 481 yards against Browns, including 145 rushing yards by <a href=#>Rudi Johnson</a>. He was in the starting lineup for the remainder of the season, in part due to the number of injuries that depleted the Bengals' offensive line. On November 12 vs. the San Diego Chargers, he helped the offense produce a season-high 545 yards and career-high 440 yards passing from <a href=#>Carson Palmer</a>. He also had a key block on Rudi Johnson's seven-yard touchdown run in first quarter.</p><p>His 52 career starts from 2002–2005 rank second in NCAA Division I history behind <a href=#>Derrick Strait</a> of Oklahoma (53 starts, 2000–2003).
