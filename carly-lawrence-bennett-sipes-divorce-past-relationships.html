Ultimately, two of the most noteworthy people from those two show's second seasons have been Carly Lawrence and Bennett Sipes.</p><p>During the second season of Too Hot to Handle, Carly Lawrence gained lots of fans who became interested in her love life. Before that, Bennett Sipes starred in the second season of Love Island USA where his tenure left fans feeling frustrated.</p><p>Sadly for Sipes and Lawrence, the fate of their <strong>past separate reality TV relationships seemed to be echoed in the news they were getting divorced</strong>.</p><p>In January 2022, Screen Rant published an article about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how Carly Lawrence's ex felt about her being involved with Bennett Sipes</a>.

Even though Lawrence and De Moor both were undeniably gorgeous together, their relationship soon faltered and they quickly put an end to it.</p><p>After their split, De Moor went on to get involved with Tabitha Clifft. Similarly, Lawrence didn't wait long to find someone new to get close to, as <strong>she went on to link up with Joey Joy</strong>.</p><p>As Screen Rant's article revealed, Chase De Moor was rooting for Carly Lawrence to find happiness after their split.

Hopefully the fact that <strong>Lawrence quickly moved in the past</strong> means she will bounce back after her divorce.</p><p>When it comes to Sipes and Call, the fact that fans were disappointed by them being eliminated quickly is similar to his divorce.
