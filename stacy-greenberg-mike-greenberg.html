For the past 18 years, Greenberg has co-hosted Mike & Mike in the Morning with former NFL player Mike Golic.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, that is about to alter. On January 12, a number of sources told Sports Illustrated that Greenberg would leave the show to launch a new ESPN show.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The morning broadcasts of SportsCenter will be replaced by the program, which is expected to be based in New York City but still contain some of its signature elements.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In addition, the TV personality hosted Duel from 2007 to 2008 and co-hosted Battle of the Network Stars on ABC, a sister network, with Joe Tessitore.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Stacy Greenberg, wife of Mike Greenberg</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Stacy Greenberg, also known as Stacy Steponate, has been happily married to Mike Greenberg for many years. The couple got hitched on September 6, 1997.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The couple initially met when Mike moved to Chicago to restart his work as a sports radio personality. At the time, Stacy provided for the family, and subsequently she helped Mike write the books.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The children’s book MVP: Most Valuable Puppy was co-written by Mike and his wife, Stacy, who is currently employed in marketing. Stacy likes to travel internationally. In the areas of travel and marketing, she has more than 15 years of expertise.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although she hasn’t maintained it since 2012, the famous spouse also oversees the website Gate1A.com.

With his wife, Mike Greenberg appears to have a five-year age difference.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Mike was born on August 6, 1967, and as of 2022, he will be 55 years old.
