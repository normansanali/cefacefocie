<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>When Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan broke up in April 2018, fans were devastated. They flooded social media with their shock and dismay. This is because the split seemed to come out of left field as there were no outward signs of any drama in the relationship. And if Tatum and Dewan could not make it work after nearly a decade of marriage that appeared to be filled with love, <a href=#>many wondered what hope there was for love for them</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fast-forward to October of the same year. Tatum and Jessie J decide at that time to go public with their relationship after keeping it under wraps for a spell. Given the love that fans had for the Magic Mike star and Dewan, it would have made sense for them to turn on Tatum and Jessie J. However, the opposite happened. Tatum and Jessie J became one of the most popular celebrity couples given how cute and flirty they were on social media. Followers of the two could not wait to see what would be posted next.</p><p>Fans were again blindsided by the 22 Jumpstreet star when he and Jessie J called it quits one year after dating. While the two <a href=#>did reconcile a couple of months later</a>, the reunion was not meant to be. But that did not stop Tatum from finding love again. And in 2021, he and Zoë Kravitz were officially a couple, while Jessie J had yet to find the one she wanted to be with, leaving fans to wonder if she was still hung up on her ex.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this was not the case as was clear when it was revealed that the Bang Bang singer and Chanan Safir Colman were an item in 2022 and reportedly very in love.</p><h2 id=jessie-j-and-channing-tatum-made-headlines-together>Jessie J And Channing Tatum Made Headlines Together</h2><p>As a couple, Jessie J and Tatum made numerous headlines as a result of their flirtatious behavior via social media. A trait that the two kept going on right up until the end when they decided to call it quits for good. Be it birthdays, performances, PDA selfies, or red-carpet events, the two kept tongues wagging with their comments to one another.</p><p>But there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one post in particular that fans took notice of that left little to the imagination</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50317364.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I lost a game of Jenga to Jessica Cornish," Tatum captioned a photo of himself in the shower. "The loser (me) had to post a picture the other person (Jessica Cornish) picked... Smh and fml… I’m never playing Jenga with her ever again."</p><p>While fans were thrilled to see Tatum nearly in the buff, Jessie J knew that she had done them a solid as well.</p><p>"Sharing is caring," the Domino singer wrote in the comments.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Pics That'll Have Jessie J Miss Channing Now That They've Split (Again)</a></span></p><p>It was posts like these where it looked like the two were very content with one another and did not take themselves too seriously that made fans adore Tatum and Jessie J as a couple. And the more they flirted, the more the press reported on them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessie-j-quietly-moved-on-with-chanan-safir-colman>Jessie J Quietly Moved On With Chanan Safir Colman</h2><p>Jessie J moved on to a relationship with Max Pham Nguyen in the months after her breakup with Tatum. And while the two did not have the same chemistry that Jessie J and Tatum had via social media, the <a href=#>photos were sweet and happy</a>. However, that relationship was not to last, as just seven months after getting together, the two split.</p><p>Because Jessie J was so open about being in a relationship with Tatum and Nguyen, it also meant that she had to publicly share when those relationships ended as well. Perhaps that is why when she and Chanan Safir Colman started dating that the Price Tag singer chose a different route, which was posting nothing at all.</p><p>As such, she and Colman were able to fly under the radar for a time as a couple, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">until some PDA caught by the paparazzi gave them away</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50028902-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While out at lunch in April 2022, the Danish-Isreali professional basketball player and Jessie J were caught kissing. When sources were contacted for the status of their relationship, it was clear that the two had been dating for a while and were somehow able to keep things under wraps during the early days of getting to know one another.</p><p>"Jessie and Chanan clearly like each other and they’ve been getting to know each other for quite a few months," the source explained after the photo of the two locking lips was snapped.</p><p>"They are just seeing what happens but as far as her friends are concerned, things are looking good for them as a couple."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jessie J Shares The Diva-Like Attitude She Has Had Since Childhood</a></span></p><p>Over the next several months, there were not any pictures on social media posted from either Jessie J or Colman to show that they were a couple. But what Jessie J did announce was that one year after she had suffered a miscarriage, she was again pregnant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And despite the fact that the Who You Are singer got pregnant sans Nguyen, although she was in a relationship with him, it was assumed that Colman was the father of this baby, a fact that may or may not be true given that nothing has ever been confirmed by Jessie J herself.</p><h2 id=are-jessie-j-and-chanan-safir-colman-still-together>Are Jessie J And Chanan Safir Colman Still Together?</h2><p>Given that Jessie J and Colman post nothing about one another and do their best to stay out of the public eye when together, it is speculated that the two are still together given that nothing has been said to the contrary.</p><p>But there may have been a few clues along the way that point to the fact that not only are Jessie J and Colman still together, the baby Jessie J gave birth to earlier this month is indeed, Colman's, and the two are in love.</p><p>On March 19, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessie J took to Instagram to write a message to her then-unborn son on Mother's Day in the UK</a>. It was in this message that much about her and Colman's relationship was revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52433329.png><p>"I love you so hard it blows my mind this is real," Jessie J wrote. "I'm yours forever my son. I cannot wait to meet you. And see this smile in real life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Jessie J Has Done Since Splitting From Channing Tatum</a></span></p><p>The Do It Like A Dude singer went on to say, "I love your Daddy so much, you wouldn't be on your way without him. He is the most patient, calm and good looking man. You are going to LOVE him when you meet him."</p><p>Colman responded to this comment with three heart emojis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that there have been no sightings of Jessie J or Colman together since this post, it is possible that the two could have broken up. But, with the emotion behind the Mother's Day post, it would be hard to believe that the singer and the professional athlete were anything other than a solid couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqujnrJutoybprKeop6yr7CMnJ%2BappGjerStxaKpZpufobqiuo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjessie-j-boyfriend-chanan-safir-colman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjessie-j-boyfriend-chanan-safir-colman.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjessie-j-boyfriend-chanan-safir-colman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjessie-j-boyfriend-chanan-safir-colman.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjessie-j-boyfriend-chanan-safir-colman.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjessie-j-boyfriend-chanan-safir-colman.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./katy-mixons-husband-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./katy-mixons-husband-list.html>Katy Mixons Husband: Who is Katy Mixon Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jazian-gortman-ready-to-takeover-basketball.html>Jazian Gortman: Ready To Takeover Basketball</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jazian-gortman-ready-to-takeover-basketball.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
