Donald Trump’s spokeswoman also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump and son Eric Trump react to his putt on the 14th green during the pro-am prior to the LIV Golf Invitational – Bedminster at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster on July 28, 2022 in Bedminster, New Jersey.</p><p>Cliff Hawkins | Getty Images</p><p>Donald Trump reportedly is considering formally announcing before this November’s mid-term election that he will be a candidate in 2024.</p><p>Trump, who lost a re-election effort to President <a href=#>Joe Biden</a>, is said to be motivated at least in part, to blunt the rising popularity among Republicans of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who himself reportedly is eyeing seeking the White House in 2024.</p><p>But some GOP elected officials and candidates are worried that if Trump does announce he is running before November, it would hurt the party’s chances of winning majorities in both chambers of Congress.</p><p>While retaining the support of many Republican voters, Trump remains a deeply controversial figure due to his refusal to accept the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election results, the subsequent Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, and other issues.</p><p>Read more of CNBC’s politics coverage:</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC News reported that a Republican National Committee official</a> told that news outlet that the RNC would stop paying legal bills for Trump as soon as he announces he is a candidate “because the party has a ‘neutrality policy’ that prohibits it from taking sides in the presidential primary.”</p><p>ABC noted that since October, the RNC has paid almost $2 million to law firms that represent Trump in lawsuits filed against him, and investigations by government entities.</p><p>This weekend’s golf event at Trump’s New Jersey club has generated controversy on multiple fronts.</p><p>The Saudi-backed LIV Golf is challenging the PGA Tour’s dominance in professional golf, which has led the PGA to suspend more than 20 players from its events for participating in LIV events without receiving releases for “conflicting even and media rights.”</p><p>LIV Golf also has been accused of being yet another “sports-wash” effort by the Saudi Arabia to improve its international reputation, which has suffered for decades because of internal government repression and human rights abuses.</p><p>Trump, who is from New York City, has been strongly criticized in recent weeks by families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks for hosting the Saudi event at his club.</p><p>Of the 19 hijackers of four planes that day, 15 were Saudi nationals. Two of the planes that were hijacked slammed into the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, which collapsed soon afterward. The Saudi government has long denied connection to the attacks.</p><p>“How much money to turn your back on your own country?” asked a woman in <a href=# rel=noopener>an ad created by 9/11 survivors and relatives </a>and directed at Trump that began airing this week.</p><p>The ad also features a man saying, “This golf tournament is taking place 50 miles from Ground Zero.”</p><p>When asked about that Thursday, <a href=# rel=noopener>Trump replied, </a>“Well,&nbsp;nobody’s gotten to the bottom of&nbsp;9/11,&nbsp;unfortunately,&nbsp;and they should have.”</p><p>But six years ago, when he was first running for president, Trump during an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” said: “Who blew up the World Trade Center? It wasn’t the Iraqis, it was Saudi — take a look at Saudi Arabia, open the documents.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcL%2FOp2StnZGosrR5xKWcnKyZpLtuvtSnZLChpJ16qLvLn2SbmZdirrV50pqsnaFdmsOmutNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fson-teases-election-run-with-golf-bag-at-saudi-event.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fson-teases-election-run-with-golf-bag-at-saudi-event.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fson-teases-election-run-with-golf-bag-at-saudi-event.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fson-teases-election-run-with-golf-bag-at-saudi-event.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fson-teases-election-run-with-golf-bag-at-saudi-event.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fson-teases-election-run-with-golf-bag-at-saudi-event.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./terry-kennedy-wife-and-family-who-is-sarah-kennedy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./terry-kennedy-wife-and-family-who-is-sarah-kennedy.html>Terry Kennedy Wife And Family, Who Is Sarah Kennedy?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./randy-savage.html>Randy Savage - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./randy-savage.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
