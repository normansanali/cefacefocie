Professional Life</h2><p>Missy had already aspired to be a model at a young age; however, without a proper opportunity, she quickly abandoned her dreams and delved into acting and reality television. Her first film role was in “Haggard,” directed by her future husband, Bam Margera, and starring Margera, Ryan Dunn, and Brandon DiCamillo. Missy has only had one more acting role since then, as Hot Nurse in the 2009 film “Minghags,” directed by Bam Margera and Brandon DiCamillo.</p><p>Melissa and Bam reconnected in the mid-2000s, and he assisted her in obtaining a few acting gigs, during which they began a romantic relationship. When their relationship became public, everyone wanted to know everything there was to know about Bam’s new girlfriend. She has, however, managed to conceal almost all of the important details about her life. Nonetheless, just before their marriage, the two launched “Bam’s Unholy Union,” a reality TV series about their life together that aired from 2006 to 2007. She and Bam continued to collaborate, and Missy landed several other roles, including one in “Bam Margera Presents: Where the #$&% Is Santa?” in 2008, which starred Bam, Brandon Novak, Mark The Bagger, and others. In the comedic style of Bam Margera, the film’s theme was celebrating Christmas and finding Santa Claus.</p><p>Furthermore, Missy posed naked for Playboy, with Bam as a guest photographer; at first, she was opposed, but after some convincing from Bam, she accepted the offer, which undoubtedly increased her public popularity.</p><h2>Who Is Missy Rothstein Dating?

On November 1, 2012, their marriage was declared null and void.</p><h2>Missy Rothstein Net Worth 2023</h2><p>Bam greatly aided her in establishing her career, and Missy rose to prominence due to their relationship and later marriage.
