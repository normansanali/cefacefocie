People will come for you and start hating on you for no reason. Kai literally stays in his on lane.

Hopefully that gets hashed out in the future. But, man I can’t believe this is a brand new podcast. It already feels pretty polished. Yachty does a really good job as a host and the editor was cracking me up with all the images and text he put at the bottom.
