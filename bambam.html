He is best known for being a member of the South Korean band ‘Got7,’ along with Junior, JB, Jackson, Yu-gym, Mark, and Young-Jae. To date, this band has issued two box sets, three studio albums, ten extended plays, and thirteen singles. Bhuwakul, who was named after Bamm-Bamm Rubble from the popular cartoon show “The Flintstones,” has also appeared in several films and variety shows as an actor and dancer. He has also given incredible live performances across the country as a singer and rapper. He and his band members received the 2015 Golden Disk Award and the Seoul Music Award. He is a very ambitious person who has set lofty goals for himself. Despite his youth, he is highly disciplined in his career and does not waste his time on frivolous pursuits. Bhuwakul, on the other hand, is averse to the media. He dislikes being in the spotlight for reasons other than his professional achievements.<h2 class=insta_newpara_desc><span id=BamBam_Career>BamBam Career</span></h2>Before joining Got7, Bhuwakul trained for three and a half years with JYP Entertainment.

The following year, Bhuwakul’s band Got7 released their debut album ‘Identity,’ as well as two EPs titled ‘Got It’ and ‘Got Love.’ This was followed by two additional EPs, titled ‘Just Right’ and ‘Mad.’<br>Bhuwakul was named the permanent host of Mnet’s ‘M! Countdown’ in 2015. He also appeared in the Korean-Chinese web drama ‘Dream Knight’ that year. A year later, the Thai actor/singer appeared on the variety show “Real Men” as well as on KBS’ “Idol Battle Likes.” The same year, he made a cameo appearance on SBS’s “Don’t Dare to Dream.” That year, he released two studio albums with the band, titled ‘Flight Log: Turbulence’ and ‘Moriagatteyo.’<br>Bhuwakul became a cast member of ‘3 zaps’ in 2017. His band Got7 released their EPs ‘Flight Log: Arrival’ and ‘7 for 7’ the same year. Then, on March 12, 2018, they released their second EP, ‘Eyes on You,’ which included the hit single “One and Only You.” Bhuwakul returned to Thailand for a military draft on April 9, 2018.<h2 class=insta_newpara_desc><span id=Personal_Existence>Personal Existence</span></h2>Kunpimook Kochakorn Bhuwakul and her husband gave birth to Bhuwakul on May 2, 1997, in Bangkok, Thailand.
