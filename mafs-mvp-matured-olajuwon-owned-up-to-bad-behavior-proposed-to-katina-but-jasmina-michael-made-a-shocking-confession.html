As previously reported host Kevin Frazier brought the final four couples back together to discuss the state of their marriages after ALL of them said “yes” on<a href=# rel=noopener> Decision Day.</a></p><h3>Olajuwon Owns Up To Bad Behavior On “Married At First Sight”</h3><p>First up were Olajuwon and Katina who confirmed that they were<strong> still together</strong>. Moreover, they confirmed that Olajuwon did some self-reflection after seeing himself act <span>like an ass</span> immaturely on TV.</p><p>O said it was “tough” to watch the moments when he berated his wife with his <a href=# rel=noopener>domestic duties demands</a> that led to him calling her “lazy.” He also added that he wondered why no one checked him about his behavior–something social media didn’t agree with.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Need to know your thoughts on Olajuwon’s self-reflection!&nbsp;?&nbsp;??<a href=#>#MAFS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bpzCPTObSE</a></p><p>— Married At 1st Sight (@MAFSLifetime) <a href=#>May 19, 2022</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Olajuwon really gon say nobody told him he was talking crazy to Katina??

You embody that,” he continued. “You taught me patience and effort is the key to a happy life and a happy marriage. Katina, I couldn’t be any happier to call you my wife, and I mean that.”</p><p>He then pulled out a ring box and got down on one knee to present his wife with a shiny new ring.</p><p>“I would hope you accept this, now you know your husband, and you’re confident to continue this journey with me,” said Olajuwon.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2134057 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2022/05/16529739472246.png alt="Married At First Sight" width=700 height=449 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-2134057 class=wp-caption-text>Source: Married At First Sight / Kinetic Content</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2134050 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2022/05/16529738744532.png alt="Married At First Sight" width=700 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-2134050 class=wp-caption-text>Source: Married At First Sight / Kinetic Content</p><p>A shocked Katina was speechless and burst into tears and O thanked her for ignoring the “Twitter fingers” of his detractors.</p><p>“I knew–My gut was telling me, don’t throw in the towel. don’t give up on him,” said Katina.</p><p>“You always treated Isaac and Olajuwon the same, as the same person,” said O referring to his pre-marriage moniker. “When everybody had the Twitter fingers and wrote online and you was reading how folks was doubting your husband, it’s very easy to follow people’s word and you never did.
