In 2017, Kaji’s parents signed a deal with PocketWatch, a startup children’s media company, which handles marketing and merchandise for Ryan’s World.

Some critics argue that the channel and Kaji’s parents exploit the young boy for profit, potentially leading to overworking and coercion. Kaji’s mother has denied these allegations, stating that her son is in charge of his own schedule.</p><p>In addition, the channel has faced criticism for not properly disclosing sponsored content. Truth in Advertising and the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint in 2019, claiming that around 90% of the channel’s videos feature paid product advertisements aimed at young viewers who may not understand the difference between a review and a commercial. The videos have also been criticized for promoting unhealthy foods.</p><p>As a result of the complaint, the FTC sued YouTube and Google for $170 million, and YouTube has since changed its rules to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC%2B2JqlZqORn7ZuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stunna-girl-real-name-and-age-how-old-is-she-face-reveal-and-wikipedia-bio-625379-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stunna-girl-real-name-and-age-how-old-is-she-face-reveal-and-wikipedia-bio-625379-html.html>Stunna Girl Real Name And Age How Old Is She?
