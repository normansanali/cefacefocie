When Carleton confronted him, he shouted “many homophobic slurs” and then shot her, San Bernardino County sheriff’s&nbsp;officials said during a Monday press conference.</p><p>Carleton, a fixture in the community and a mom of nine, died at the scene while Ikeguchi fled.</p><p>Deputies caught up to him about a mile from the store and he opened fire — blasting multiple squad cars, San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus told reporters.&nbsp;The officers returned fire and fatally struck Ikeguchi. No deputies were injured.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Travis Ikeguchi, 27, was killed by police following the deadly shooting of Carleton. <span class=credit>Twitter</span></figure><p>Ikeguchi — who was reported missing by his family a day before the hate-fueled shooting — frequently posted anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion remarks on X, formerly known as Twitter, and the far-right platform Gab.</p><p>In one hateful, foreboding post in June, he wrote, “What to do with the [Pride] flag?” above a photo of a burning rainbow flag on X. He pinned the post to his profile, which Dicus <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed as his.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The shooting began after Travis Ikeguchi tore down a Pride flag outside the Mag.Pi clothing store. <span class=credit>AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>He also shared an illustration of a Pride flag on fire on his now-defunct Gab page under the guise of Christianity and made anti-government and anti-police statements.</p><p>“We need to STOP COMPROMISING on this LGBT dictatorship…True followers of Christ SHOULD NOT and NEVER TOLERATE this stupid indoctrination of LGBT agenda in marriage or in our own businesses,” he captioned the illustration. “…Who has the courage to post this and feel no shame of it!?”</p><p>Ikeguchi often shared and retweeted Bible verses between typing his revolting posts.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ikeguchi had a history of making anti-LGBTQ remarks on his social media accounts and made several homophobic slurs to Carleton before he killed her, officials said. <span class=credit>NBC News</span></figure><p>Discus said Ikeguchi was not known to law enforcement before Friday’s shooting.</p><p>The alleged killer used a semi-automatic handgun that was not registered to him and he was not licensed to carry a concealed weapon, the sheriff said.</p><p>The investigation into the shooting — about which several witnesses called 911 — is ongoing.</p><p>Carleton, whom friends knew as Lauri, is survived by her husband and nine children in what she had described as a “blended” family.</p><p>She did not identify as a member of the LGBTQ community but was an unwavering supporter, according to the Lake Arrowhead LGBTQ organization.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Carleton, a mom of nine, was a beloved figure in the community and a long-time shop owner. <span class=credit>Mountain Provisions Cooperative/Facebook</span></figure><p>Carleton was remembered in an outpouring of tributes from names big and small, far and wide.</p><p>Friends, family and admirers turned the outside of her shop into a makeshift memorial with bundles of flowers and Pride flags as a single bullet hole could be seen through its glass door.</p><p>“Thank you for standing up for what’s right,” one person wrote in a note left among roses and sunflowers.</p><p>“Bridesmaids” director Paul Feig called Carleton a friend.</p><p>“She was a wonderful person who did so much for the LGBTQ+ community as well as the community at large,” he wrote on X. “What happened to her is an absolute tragedy.
