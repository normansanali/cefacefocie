Here is the expanse of its territory in 1683, when the empire sprawled across 2 million square miles. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Viking Expansion History Map</h2><span class=caption-body>Though not as expansive as the Romans or the Mongols, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Vikings</a> certainly left their mark on history.

From the Age of Exploration to its waning days in the mid-20th century, nearly 98 percent of Earth's present-day population lives in a country that was once colonized or subjugated by the British.</p><p>Just 22 countries in the world have never been invaded by the British — and they're shown in purple on this map.</p></span><span class=credit>Author Stuart Laycock</span><h2 class=title>European Colonization History Map</h2><span class=caption-body>Likewise, much of the world has been colonized by Europe.

All of Europe looked different following the conflict. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Europe Under Nazi Control During World War II</h2><span class=caption-body>At the height of the Nazi regime, the Third Reich controlled most of the European continent. From areas under direct occupation to German puppet states, Nazi rule stretched from France to the Balkans to western Russia.<p>Though they were slowly turned back by the Red Army, <a href=# rel=noopener>Adolf Hitler</a> refused to accept defeat until 1945 — ensuring that much of Germany would be reduced to rubble by the end of World War II.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Changing Power Dynamics During World War II</h2><span class=caption-body>But <a href=# rel=noopener>World War II</a> was truly a world war.

This map shows the extent of their assault. More than 4,000 Allied troops died, but British, American, and Canadian forces were able to breach the Nazis' defenses. This helped turn the tide against Germany during the war.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>World War II After D-Day</h2><span class=caption-body>This remarkable map, which depicts the days following D-Day, shows how the balance of power swiftly shifted. </span><span class=credit>EmperorTigerstar/YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Bombing Of Japanese Cities</h2><span class=caption-body>This map shows, in red, how much of major Japanese cities were destroyed by bombing during World War II.<p>In addition to nuclear bombs, Japan was also devastated by fire bombings.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Bombings In London During World War II</h2><span class=caption-body>Likewise, this map shows every place in London that was bombed during the Blitz, which took place between October 7, 1940, and June 6, 1941. More than 40,000 British civilians were killed in these attacks during World War II. </span><span class=credit>Bomb Sight project</span><h2 class=title>Bombing Of Dresden</h2><span class=caption-body>Dresden, Germany, was also extensively bombed during World War II.

To eradicate these tribes — or at least force them to submit to American authorities — the U.S. government decided to wipe out their primary source of food: bison.</p><p>They put Civil War hero William T. Sherman in charge of the endeavor, who said, "I think it would be wise to invite all the sportsmen of England and America…this fall for a Grand Buffalo hunt and make one grand sweep of them all."</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Slave States And Free States Before The Civil War</h2><span class=caption-body>This map shows the teetering balance between "slave states" and "free states" leading up to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Civil War</a>. Though American policymakers tried to avoid conflict with various compromises, the tension over slavery in the United States eventually boiled over into war. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Lynchings In The United States</h2><span class=caption-body>This powerful map shows the recorded lynchings across the United States from 1900 to 1931, represented with dots. Though most were concentrated in the South, lynchings happened all over the country. </span><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><h2 class=title>Every Presidential Election From 1860 To 2004</h2><span class=caption-body>Ever since the Civil War, Americans have swung between supporting Democrats and Republicans for president.<p>Though the South used to favor Democratic candidates, and the North used to favor Republican ones, shifting demographics and party priorities eventually switched regional preferences in many areas.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Changing Immigration Trends In The United States</h2><span class=caption-body>This animated map shows how immigration trends changed in the United States, from primarily German immigrants to primarily Mexican ones. </span><span class=credit>Pew Research Center</span><h2 class=title>Diversity In The United States</h2><span class=caption-body>This map helps paint a picture of American diversity. It highlights which ethnicities have made a home in certain counties in the greatest numbers — and where these communities were living by the year 2000. </span><span class=credit>U.S. Census Bureau</span><h2 class=title>Evolution Of The United States</h2><span class=caption-body>The United States famously started as 13 colonies before solidifying into states and expanding into territories.

But these 35 world history maps can show us where we've been.</p><p>Some of the historical maps displayed above highlight how empires have risen and fallen throughout the centuries. We can learn how the Mongols once <a href=# rel=noopener>consumed a continent</a>. We can see how Roman roads once stretched across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. And we can marvel at how the Ottoman Empire came to spread across 2 million square miles.</p><p>Other history maps show how warfare has touched various places around the world, and how things have changed after these battles have passed.</p><p>Several of the historical maps in the gallery focus on North America. While perusing them, you can learn about the <a href=# rel=noopener>decimation of the American bison</a>. You can also see how diverse Indigenous tribes once controlled large swaths of land throughout the continent before European settlers arrived.</p><p>In one particularly engaging map, you can take a look back at the results of every U.S. presidential election from 1860 to 2004.</p><p>All in all, these history maps present the path of mankind in a variety of ways. Instead of telling just one narrative, they explore the evolution of people, places, and politics from above. Using the natural boundaries of continents, they show how human history has shifted with time.</p><p>Sometimes, they tell tragic stories from the past. Other times, they present a more hopeful future.</p><p>After looking through these world history maps, check out these <a href=#>maps that explain America</a>.
