<time>03 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The long-running The Fast and the Furious franchise’s ninth instalment, F9, opened in theatres to a lot of Twitter excitement. Dominic “Dom” Toretto, played by Vin Diesel, and his motley family have long been the subject of fan speculation. However, compared to other earlier films in the series, this most recent entry received a different kind of reception.</p><p>As soon as F9 was released in North American theatres, a plethora of memes honouring Dom and his devotion to his family appeared on Twitter. In other memes, Dom even crosses over into other fandoms to emphasise the value of family, which often results in absurd events.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Dom Joins The Justice League</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Dom Saves The Lion King</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Dom Wick?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Family Is Inevitable</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Fast Wars: The Furious Awaken</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Friends ARE Family, Dom</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> He May Be Your Father, Boy, But He’s Not Your Family</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Near, Far, Wherever You Are…</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Vin Diesel Goes To Olive Garden</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> What’s Stronger Than A Hulk?</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Dom_Joins_The_Justice_League>Dom Joins The Justice League</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>Happy Creative… All Love, Always <a href=#>https://t.co/v2XBPUs43n</a></p><p>— Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) <a href=#>May 23, 2021</a></p><p>Characters pleading with Dom Toretto to refrain from facing their primary antagonist alone because it is far too risky is a popular format of Dom Toretto memes. Dom then turns to face the audience and says, “No adversary is a match for the pure all-pervasive force of family.</p><p>The approach taken by @Deepans30707976 to this format turns out to be the most successful; as a general of Apokolips, Steppenwolf is a formidable adversary and could have seriously threatened Dom if it weren’t for family support. Deepanshu seemed so confident in this contest that he responded to Vin Diesel directly in the hopes that he will notice and enjoy the meme.</p><h3><span id=Dom_Saves_The_Lion_King>Dom Saves The Lion King</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>My favorite Vin diesel memes.. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uLUtIwqhT7</a></p><p>— Daniel™ (@Donanuna) <a href=#>July 9, 2021</a></p><p>Dom Toretto memes have even made it into animated films. In this meme, Mufasa from Disney’s The Lion King is on the verge of meeting his fabledly sad death when he is saved by an unlikely hero: Dom, who drives through through the stampede. Dom manages to save Mufasa in time with a little Photoshop and drives him to safety.</p><p>This meme not only avoids one of the most painful memories from many fans’ childhoods, but it also offers a creative idea for upcoming Fast and Furious films. It would be an interesting setpiece for Dom and his team to drive through a chaotic rush. Vin Diesel, other performers, or animals might be safely depicted in a stampede using CGI, which has advanced significantly in recent years.</p><h3><span id=Dom_Wick>Dom Wick?</span></h3><p>comparable action series All dog-loving fans of the movie John Wick concur that the title character’s actions in the first movie are entirely sensible, since they too would exact retribution on anyone who injured their beloved dog. The movie has a large meme following. Dom Toretto, who is seen here offering his assistance to John, is one of these persons.</p><p>Dogs are a beloved member of any family, and as can be seen on People.com, Vin Diesel loves dogs. Dom appreciates all family members, no matter how large or tiny, and fans of both films are excited about the prospect of Dom and John Wick teaming up.</p><h3><span id=Family_Is_Inevitable>Family Is Inevitable</span></h3><p>While Groot was present for the final showdown with Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, some fans speculate what may have happened if Thanos had been killed by a different Vin Diesel character. Here comes @MemesCentral, who offers this meme of Dom facing off against Thanos while holding the Infinity Gauntlet in place of Tony Stark.</p><p>Tony Stark gave his life to utilise the Infinity Gauntlet, which is too strong for ordinary humans to use against Thanos. But Dom Toretto’s faith in the strength of his family is so great that it just could give him the willpower he needs to outlive even death.</p><h3><span id=Fast_Wars_The_Furious_Awaken>Fast Wars: The Furious Awaken</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>Morning y’all! Are Vin Diesel memes still a thing? lol ??? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9NpeDQddDM</a></p><p>— Enigma Kai (@Enigma_Kai) <a href=#>July 7, 2021</a></p><p>One of the most puzzling scenes in F9 that made no sense is when the characters Roman and Tej modify their car to fly into space. In this meme, a fleet of hot rods shows up to aid Star Wars pilot Poe Dameron, bringing the situation to its logical conclusion. And Dom Toretto himself is in charge of the cavalry.</p><p>Poe almost appears to be reacting to Dom’s declaration that family is the strongest thing in the universe based on his expression of astonishment and relief. The second trilogy would have consisted of just one film if Dom and his family had genuinely cooperated with the resistance to the First Order.</p><h3><span id=Friends_ARE_Family_Dom>Friends ARE Family, Dom</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>I have never seen a Fast or a Furious but I will never get tired of the Vin Diesel family memes. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YENl0YjA0e</a></p><p>— beccagrawl (@beccagrawl) <a href=#>July 10, 2021</a></p><p>Vin Diesel’s character, Dom, is quoted in The Fast and the Furious 7 as saying that he has no friends and only family. Despite @beccagrawl’s denials that she has ever seen a Fast and the Furious movie, her meme wonderfully encapsulates Dom’s perspective on life, in which family comes first.</p><p>Both Family Matters and Friends are included in this meme, which takes its formatting cues from the Drake meme. These two shows have been regularly mentioned in previous Dom memes. Even though it’s obvious that Vin Diesel isn’t playing his character Dom in this scene, the joke’s origin is still clear.</p><h3><span id=He_May_Be_Your_Father_Boy_But_He8217s_Not_Your_Family>He May Be Your Father, Boy, But He’s Not Your Family</span></h3><p>In a reference to another popular franchise in which Vin Diesel appeared, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, Dom arrives just in time to exact revenge on Ego the Living Planet for killing Meredith Quill too soon. What really distinguishes this meme from others is the inventive usage of Quill shooting Ego just after the reveal and the great photo-shopping of Dom.</p><p>At the start of the Dom Toretto meme deluge, @HowieBling, whose account has since been made private, first shared this meme. Thankfully, the meme is still around for other family aficionados to enjoy.</p><h3><span id=Near_Far_Wherever_You_Are8230>Near, Far, Wherever You Are…</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>im here for vin diesel family memes? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wDebkqUUOo</a></p><p>— chichi??? (@25ShadesOfBrown) <a href=#>July 7, 2021</a></p><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s careers were established by the critically acclaimed film Titanic, yet even its admirers disagree on its infamous conclusion. Many people contend that Jack, played by DiCaprio, need not have died because both he and Rose could have fit on the piece of driftwood Rose used to reach safety.</p><p>This Twitter user seems to concur with this idea and disproved his assertions by posting a meme of Dom saving Jack’s life. Despite its lower quality, this meme more than makes up for it by highlighting Dom’s resolve to save his family members no matter what.</p><h3><span id=Vin_Diesel_Goes_To_Olive_Garden>Vin Diesel Goes To Olive Garden</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>My contribution to the Vin Diesel family meme collection ❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/c9hyiUvMcM</a></p><p>— Shelby Young (@shelby_young) <a href=#>July 7, 2021</a></p><p>Besides complex street racing scenes. Characters frequently have meals with one another in the Fast and the Furious movies, whether they’re prepping for difficulties to come or just having fun as a family.</p><p>Shelby Young, the current Princess Leia voice actress, made a contribution by quoting the catchphrase of the Olive Garden chain of restaurants and inserting Dom within the eatery. According to Hard-Drive.net, Olive Garden and The Fast and the Furious previously worked together on a series of family-focused advertisements, which spawned a tonne of memes from fans who want to see Dom eat at an Olive Garden in the upcoming film.</p><h3><span id=What8217s_Stronger_Than_A_Hulk>What’s Stronger Than A Hulk?</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>If Vin Diesel fought Loki in Avengers <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3Ji5r9vZ8u</a></p><p>— SVM (@ShivamChatak) <a href=#>July 5, 2021</a></p><p>SVM (@ShivamChatak) July 5, 2021 @ShivamChatak is the user who first shared a number of Dom Toretto memes on Twitter, igniting the ensuing family meme avalanche. This meme, in particular, has the good fortune to feature Loki from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, another well-known character who is now trending.</p><p>In this instance, Dom simply dismisses Loki’s warnings in a manner reminiscent of Iron Man in The Avengers. Dom, though, has his entire family prepared to leave. The screenshots of Loki and Dom utilised here are a fantastic fit, and it nearly appears as though they are sharing the same place. Dom even appears to be looking directly at Loki while grinning.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
