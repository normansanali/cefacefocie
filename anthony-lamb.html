Her mother committed suicide when she was eight years old after arguing with her alcoholic father.</p><p>Following the incident, Rachel’s behavior became worse, resulting in multiple stays in a juvenile detention facility and even once being put under house arrest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Anthony-Lamb-With-His-Mother-Rachel.jpg><p>When Rachel became pregnant with Anthony at 16, his father invited a couple looking to adopt over to the house to meet his daughter.</p><p>No way was Rachel going to give her baby to them or anyone else. Then her father gave her only two options: give the baby up for adoption or get kicked out of the house.</p><p>Rachel fled to her aunt in Rochester, New York, on November 1, 1997. Anthony was born two weeks after Rachel’s 17th birthday the following January.</p><p>To sustain themselves, she has worked in various occupations, including certified nursing assistant, nurse, carpenter, commercial roofer, and even worked as an Uber driver.</p><h2>Meeting With His Biological Father He Never Knew</h2><p>As Lamb prepared to enroll in Vermont as a high school senior, his life took an unexpected turn.</p><p>Rachel was in a relationship when she became pregnant in Florida, but she also had sexual relations with someone else around the same time Anthony was conceived.</p><p>Rachel’s sister, Julie, encouraged her to contact the other man, Nate Larkins, whom she found through online research.</p><p>After years of no communication, Rachel contacted Nate Larkins on Facebook at her sister’s urging.</p><p>She shared some photos of Anthony, which resembled Larkins’ children.</p><p>Nate Larkins’ then-girlfriend discovered Rachel’s messages, cutting off contact for over a year until Rachel reached out again to apologize for any intrusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Larkins had ended his relationship with his girlfriend, she had damaged his phone and erased a significant amount of his data.</p><p>After Anthony committed to Vermont, Rachel, and Larkins agreed to a paternity test, which revealed a 99.9 percent match between Anthony and Larkins.</p><p>Larkins reached out to Lamb to apologize for not being there, and they bonded over text messages.</p><h3>Anthony Lamb And His Father, Nate Larkins, Finally Met In 2017</h3><p>After some initial hesitation, they arranged to meet at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point during Vermont’s Gulf Coast Showcase tournament in November of his first year.</p><p>They shared a dry sense of humor in Anthony’s hotel room and joked to ease the tension.</p><p>Larkins jokingly remarked, “I’d love to grab you and kiss you, but you’re 6-5,” and joked that he was the source of Lamb’s basketball talent since he played junior college basketball.</p><p>Their first meeting was filled with jokes and laughter, and Larkins happily embraced Lamb as family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Anthony-Lamb-With-His-Father-Nate-Larkins.jpg><p>Through this newfound relationship, Lamb also gained three new siblings- Tyrese, Naomi, and Nate Jr and a grandmother, Dorothy.</p><p>During his visits to Florida, Anthony met and spent time with all his half-siblings.</p><p>While Larkins has been supportive and available, he respects Anthony’s wishes regarding their contact and does not intrude.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Anthony Lamb graduated from Greece Athena High School in New York, where he had an impressive senior season averaging 30 points and 17 rebounds.</p><p>He helped lead the team to a number-one ranking in the New York and Section V Class AI final.</p><p>After finishing high school, Lamb attended the

between games.</p><p>He described feeling depressed and emotionally paralyzed and stated that moment as his lowest point.</p><p>Lamb credits the school’s full-time sports psychologist, Ari Shapiro-Miller, as a crucial paternal figure and sounding board during his darkest moments.</p><p>Vermont is one of the few schools to employ a full-time team psychologist, and Shapiro-Miller is available to all of the school’s 400-plus student-athletes.</p><p>He attends every Vermont practice and game, and his work with Lamb and other athletes has been invaluable in helping them address their mental health issues.</p><p>Vermont coach John Becker also played an essential role in Lamb’s life by helping him process his childhood experiences and teaching him how to channel his emotions positively.</p><h2>Sexual Assault by Anthony Lamb at the University of Vermont?</h2><p>In December 2022, former UVM swimmer Kendall Ware and two other students sued the University of Vermont for mishandling cases of “student-on-student harassment and sexual assault.”</p><p>Ware alleged that Anthony Lamb forced a physical relationship on her on September 7, 2019, during an off-campus party and

hosted by the Vermont men’s basketball team, including Lamb.</p><p>While trying to mend their relationship, Lamb forced Ware, which she considers an assault. Lamb was a junior, and Ware was 19 at the time.</p><p>Ware reported the alleged rape and two other instances of sexual misconduct, including an incident where Lamb filmed her during intimacy without permission, to UVM’s Title IX Office on October 7, 2019, hoping the school would investigate.</p><p>The complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Burlington alleges that the athletic director and other employees “steered” Lamb’s accuser away from filing a formal complaint and misled her about the available remedies and potential consequences for Lamb.</p><p>The lawsuit also alleges that the university continued to use Lamb in its sports advertisements despite an investigation into his alleged “sexual misconduct”.</p><p>As per the <a href=# rel=noopener>Athletic</a>, Lamb has denied the accusations, stating that the allegations made against him are false, and he has always been cooperative with any investigation into the matter.</p><p>The Golden State Warriors, Lamb’s current team, stated that they conducted their due diligence before signing him and will act accordingly if any new information arises.</p><h2>Net Worth & Contracts</h2><p>Anthony Lamb holds an estimated net worth between $800k-$1 million.
