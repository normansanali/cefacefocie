The Home Depot Girl, has gained popularity on Twitter due to claims that she is “too pretty.” The internet sensation has received accolades for her faith and sense of style. Ariana Josephine, also known as Home Depot Girl, works at the major retailer in order to make the “right money,” as she stated in one of her tweets.</p><p>Learn more about the viral lady. Here we cover her age, birthday, and details about her boyfriend.</p><h3><strong>Meet Ariana Josephine aka The Home Depot Girl</strong></h3><p>Many social media users praised Ariana Josephine for pursuing academics and other opportunities to grow her money rather than becoming a model and commented on her beauty on Twitter. She also received criticism from many internet users, however, for obliquely defending what appeared to be a number of models and professionals in the adult entertainment industry in her individual tweets by asserting that not all money is “good money.”</p><p>Independent tweets from Ariana Josephine have swept Twitter. Some online commenters praised and inspired her for attempting to succeed without resorting to her attractiveness, while others criticized her ambiguous language that said not all money is “right money.” In her initial post, she discussed how others had remarked that she was too attractive to work at Home Depot.</p><p>She recently sat down with Distractify and spoke, “I was shocked because it was a joke and [it] actually blew up.”</p><p>Texas-based Ariana claimed that she started working at the home improvement company three months ago in order to take advantage of the perks, which include a 401(k). While she has always created content, her new moniker as “Home Depot Girl”—as bestowed upon her by the internet—has resulted in a marked rise in communications and online attention.</p><p>The NBA legend Shaq is said to have Dm’ed the viral Home Depot girl, which helped her become an overnight internet hit. But it’s not what you may expect. Ariana recently posted a screenshot of the 51-year-old former professional basketball player’s direct message with her on Instagram. “When Shaq texts you know you doing something right okay!” she captioned the story.</p><p>According to the image, Shaq texted her “Don’t let them people bother you.” He allegedly went on to advise her not to read online comments or pay too much attention to what other people think. “Don’t read the comments stuff like that will drive u crazy,” he said.</p><p>The screenshot shows a cheeky comment, “Have a great day tell all your boyfriends I said hello.” Ariana replied with a “HAHA I will thank you.”</p><p>Some social media users assumed right away that Shaq was attempting to take a shot at the beautiful influencer. But according to a post by DJ Akademiks, the former basketball player soon set the record straight.</p><p>Shaq’s reaction to the circumstance is depicted in Akademiks’ post. The Hall of Famer reportedly responded to Akademiks’ remark on whether or not he was attempting to hit on the Home Depot girl by saying, “Just lifting people that’s what the diesel do, baby I uplift people google me.”</p><p>“I thought it was cool to see someone inspirational give me kind words because I actually wasn’t taking all the attention too well at that moment,” she told Distractify.</p><h3><strong>Ariana Josephine Age</strong></h3><p>Ariana Josephine is 21 years old as of June 2023.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Ariana Josephine From?</strong></h3><p>Ariana Josephine is currently residing in Houston, Texas.
