After watching the quartet of bright street-savvy kids from South Central Los Angeles push their way through high school despite the challenges of living in a&nbsp;gang dominated neighborhood and finding themselves constantly mixed up with some kind of trouble, only need to graduate and still remain friends is an epic story enough to tug at anyone’s heartstrings. Of course, it’s a great happy ending, but knowing they won’t be around anymore kind of makes the victory bittersweet.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Not to worry though, there are still several teenage dramas to jump into once you’re done binge watching On My Block for the third time that are sure to help you get over the loss.

It’s actually kind of surreal…</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Each season (comprised of two parts at a time) focuses on a group of friends from each generation as they deal with sexual identity, mental illness, romantic entanglements, and substance abuse on their road to adulthood.
