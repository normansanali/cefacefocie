The vlogger embodied the movie character with her long blonde hair pulled back into a plait apart from two strands framing her face, and her makeup accentuating her strong cheekbones. The focus was firmly on the 19-year-old's eyes which were outlined with striking dark makeup. She looked every bit the fierce survivor while posing in a leather outfit alongside partner <a class=hm-link href=#>AJ</a>, who captioned the picture with the iconic movie quote: "May the Odds be ever in your favour”.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Dev Griffin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac136d94f9b7-dev-griffiths-z.jpg><p id=efwsolRQWa7G data-wc=100>It's safe to say that <span><strong>Dev</strong></span> did not go unnoticed in his head-to-toe blue makeup for his role as the Genie from . From the dark blue contouring around his cheekbones and collarbone to the black eyeliner and silver glitter framing his eyes, makeup artist Nadine O'Toole transformed Dev into a very convincing Disney character. Alongside the gold accessories in his hair and his styled beard, fans were very impressed with his overall look. The only issue was that he ended up turning his partner Dianne into a blue monkey! From the judge's scores, we'd say it was worth it.&nbsp;</p><p id=eF3V6QHCtcGf data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Saffron Barker swears by this £3.99 concealer for her daytime makeup look</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Dianne Buswell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/81e7fd4282e2-dev-dianne-strictly-z.jpg><p id=ec16JN0l7Yu5 data-wc=119>With purple and silver eyes, a brown heart-shaped nose, and wisps of hair framing her eyes, <a class=hm-link href=#>Dianne</a> looked like a very sweet version of monkey Abu. She posted a photo of herself and Dev on Instagram and thanked the hair and makeup team:&nbsp; "I must say this is prob the best movie week I have seen every body is AMAZING! !!!!!!! Enjoy the show tonight guys you don’t wanna miss it ! You won’t want to even blink trust me [monkey and genie emojis] @dev @bbcstrictly also the costume and makeup department have exceeded expectations [clapping emojis] thanks team." Her boyfriend Joe Sugg showed his support for the dancing pair, stating: "This is sooo cool! You both look great!"</p><h2 dir=ltr>Anneka Rice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3a60fdfd97a-anneka-rice-strictly-z.jpg><p id=euVESK7fif69 data-wc=141>With her luscious blonde hair and slim figure, <a class=hm-link href=#>Anneka</a> was destined to mimic Uma Thurman as the Bride in . Smiling for the camera in the Strictly dressing room, Anneka can be seen wearing soft makeup that brought out her natural beauty, including gold sparkly eyeshadow, lashings of mascara and glossy lips. But she revealed that while she looked the part, she was nervous to perform in Uma's shoes, stating: "Ready for my Uma Thurman moment... don’t worry, I’ll take my dressing gown off... #strictly @bbcstrictly #terrified". The TV star looked incredible sporting a yellow jacket, black trousers and matching boots, but she told Claudia that she was disappointed not to be wearing a dress. "They put me in this [a Kill Bill suit] this week – you don't get a choice – I'm longing to be back in a dress!"</p><h2 dir=ltr>Emma Barton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a9bb90c430a1-emma-barton-strictly-z.jpg><p id=eAjuiOWagLVT data-wc=112><a class=hm-link href=#>Emma</a> rocked the glam 1960s hair and makeup alongside partner <a class=hm-link href=#>Anton du Beke</a> for their -inspired performance. Her eyes were the star of her outfit, with statement black winged eyeliner giving her a cat-eye effect, surrounded by silver glitter on her eyelids and below her lower lashes. And let's not forget the all-important spidery, long eyelashes and pale pout. Emma's look was created by makeup artist Lisa Armstrong, and fans were quick to comment on her fabulous transformation, stating "Wow. That's incredible. Looks fab. Xxx" and "Wow! The make up on this show is simply the best! You girls are amazing! Love your work." We think they looked groovy, baby. (It had to be done!)</p><p id=eDcma0OYJFlS data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Craig Revel Horwood in TEARS after awkward exchange with Strictly's Anton du Beke</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Janette Manrara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/729c2fde7c9e-janette-manrara-strictly-z.jpg><p id=eU0oYyCGS-yZ data-wc=126>Not many people can get away with yellow face paint, but <a class=hm-link href=#>Janette</a> is one of the lucky few. The professional dancer dressed as Pikachu to perform the Paso Doble to the theme tune, Gotta Catch 'Em All, with partner <a class=hm-link href=#>Will Bayley</a>. As well as huge yellow and black ears, she sported dark eye makeup, red lipstick, rosy red cheeks, and a matching glittery nose in the shape of a heart. She revealed it wasn't hard for her to get into character, stating on on Wednesday night: "I am very excited to say I am Pikachu and then this is the gorgeous Ash. But I've discovered I am a lot like Pikachu in real life. Apparently cute and fuzzy, but then don't p*** Pikachu off!"</p><h2 dir=ltr>Catherine Tyldesley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/67c587e7e3bf-catherine-tyldesley-strictly-z.jpg><p id=ehbVI-5QQR4J data-wc=70>For her emotional performance playing Lady Gaga's character Ally from , <a class=hm-link href=#>Catherine</a> sported simple makeup by Nadine O'Toole. Far from the bold blue of Dev's character, she opted for blacks and browns to frame her eyes alongside mascara and pink lipstick. Paired with her long curly hair and flowing green midi-dress, Cath's portrayal of the romantic love story brought some of the audience and the judges to tears.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Amy Dowden</h2><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eOeiHI6L6SJO data-wc=8><strong>Watch: Amy Dowden having her tiger makeup done.</strong></p><p id=e-mn2HgaA16Y data-wc=125><a class=hm-link href=#>Karim</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Amy</a> had some of the most elaborate costumes and makeup for their performance. Amy looked fabulous as a tiger, with black cat eyes, blended orange and yellow facepaint, intricate tiger strips framing her upper face, and gems on the tip of her nose. Although tigers are a very popular animal for children's face paint and adult's fancy dress, our attempts to achieve a fierce, realistic animal never seem to go to plan - and from a video uploaded by makeup artist Lottie B, we now understand why. The video shows Amy's transformation from fresh-faced to tiger, and it looks like a long and difficult process. The end result looked incredible, but maybe we'll be leaving this to the professionals in the future.&nbsp;</p><p id=e28O92vla-PG data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly babies: see which professional dancers are proud parents</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Michelle Visage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/40ca8d9839fc-michelle-visage-strictly-z.jpg><p id=eU7YJV5ZzixP data-wc=93>Who better to pull off the glitz and glam of than <a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Visage</a>? The judge is no stranger to fabulous hair and makeup, and she embraced the style for her performance as Liza Minnelli's character Sally Bowles. Michelle wore her dark hair in glamorous waves with a strand of hair trailing down her cheekbone, and Bryony Blake achieved her look using bright blue eye makeup, bold red lips and a beauty spot. We're not sure we'd have the sass or confidence to pull this off, but Michelle certainly does!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSao5WqvXB%2Bj2pwamhga4R5g49sZqysop6wtbjYZqSao5ViwrF5y6impKtdm7%2BwuYympq%2BhlWLEprHKZmlpaWlk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstrictly-make-up-looks-from-movie-week-2019.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstrictly-make-up-looks-from-movie-week-2019.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstrictly-make-up-looks-from-movie-week-2019.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstrictly-make-up-looks-from-movie-week-2019.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstrictly-make-up-looks-from-movie-week-2019.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstrictly-make-up-looks-from-movie-week-2019.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./david-beckham-king-arthur-makeup.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./david-beckham-king-arthur-makeup.html>You Won't Recognize David Beckham in 'King Arthur'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./weston-koury.html>Weston Koury Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./weston-koury.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
