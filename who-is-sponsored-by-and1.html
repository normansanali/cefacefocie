Over the years, the brand has established partnerships with notable players from the NBA, high school teams, and AAU circuits. Some of the athletes sponsored by AND1 include NBA stars Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, and Stephon Marbury.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>AND1's journey began in 1993 when it was founded by Jay Coen Gilbert, Seth Berger, and Tom Austin in Philadelphia. Initially, the brand focused on selling t-shirts with basketball trash talk slogans and catering to streetball players. However, it quickly gained popularity and expanded its reach. By its second year, AND1 t-shirts were being sold in 1,500 stores nationwide.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 1996, AND1 made its first major move into the NBA by signing Stephon Marbury as its first NBA ambassador. Marbury's endorsement helped elevate AND1's profile and opened the door for further collaborations with NBA players. This marked the beginning of AND1's presence in professional basketball.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The following year, in 1997, AND1 launched its first pair of basketball sneakers, signaling its move into the footwear market. This expansion allowed the brand to further solidify its position and appeal to basketball players of all levels.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>However, it was in 1998 that AND1 truly made waves with the release of the "Skip Tape". The "Skip Tape" was a videotape featuring streetball stunts by Rafer Alston. This tape generated immense excitement and buzz around AND1, helping the brand gain even more recognition in the basketball community.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>To further capitalize on this success, AND1 started producing "AND1 Mixtapes". These mixtapes featured streetball moves set to hip-hop music, showcasing the skills of various players. The mixtapes became a major selling tool for AND1, with approximately 200,000 tapes distributed in just three weeks.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2000, AND1 reached another milestone when NBA star Vince Carter wore the brand's Tai Chi shoes during an iconic performance in the NBA Dunk Contest. Carter's electrifying dunks while wearing AND1 shoes captured the attention of basketball fans worldwide, solidifying AND1's reputation as a brand associated with the on-court performance.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The success of AND1 continued as more NBA players signed with the brand. One notable athlete who joined AND1's roster of sponsored players was Kevin Garnett, a future NBA Hall of Famer. Garnett's endorsement further enhanced AND1's credibility and visibility within the basketball community.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>AND1's sponsorship efforts were not limited to the NBA alone. The brand also extended its support to high school and AAU teams in the United States. By sponsoring these teams, AND1 aimed to nurture young talent and promote its products among aspiring basketball players.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>AND1 has sponsored a range of athletes, including NBA stars such as Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, and Stephon Marbury. The brand's journey from selling t-shirts to becoming a prominent name in the basketball world is a testament to its commitment to the game and its ability to connect with players at all levels. Through its sponsorships, AND1 has not only elevated its own brand but has also contributed to the growth and development of basketball talent across different platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlmah6tLzOp6qoqpWZeqPFjJqlnWk%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-sponsored-by-and1.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-sponsored-by-and1.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-sponsored-by-and1.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-sponsored-by-and1.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-sponsored-by-and1.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-sponsored-by-and1.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-who-is-brett-phillips-wife-brianna-hillman-phillips.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-who-is-brett-phillips-wife-brianna-hillman-phillips.html>Who Is Who is Brett Phillips Wife Brianna Hillman Phillips?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-gunplay-where-does-he-come-from-his-girlfriend-wife-net-worth.html>Who is Gunplay, where does he come from?His girlfriend, wife, net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-gunplay-where-does-he-come-from-his-girlfriend-wife-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
