As a result, it has become increasingly common for people to find significant others in non-traditional ways. For example, at one time, a lot of people were embarrassed to admit they met their partner through an online dating service but these days, nobody bats an eye at talking about that truth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, just because a couple meets in a non-traditional way doesn’t mean they are going to stay together forever. After all, <a href=#>a lot of 90 Day Fiancé couples are toxic</a>, to say the least. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, is there any way to ensure you find the right partner? According to something Fran Drescher once said, she was able to find her husband for one reason, they were “programmed” to meet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Married At First Sight: Ranking The Most Toxic Couples So Far</a></span></p><h2 id=an-alien-perspective>An Alien Perspective</h2><p>In 2012, Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson were making the rounds to promote their TV show Happily Divorced. While talking to The Huffington Post, Drescher talked about the origins of her relationship with Jacobson who she married in 1978. As it turns out, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">believes that Drescher and Jacobson were “programmed” to meet</a> and she means that literally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it is pretty unusual for anyone to talk about their belief that they’ve seen real-life aliens. However, there is <a href=#>another famous actor who believes they’ve interacted with aliens</a>. On top of that, <a href=#>one of The Beatles even claimed they met with aliens</a>. Still, Drescher’s belief about her alien experience is extreme even compared to a lot of people who think they interacted with extraterrestrials. After all, not only does Drescher think that a chip was placed inside her body, she believes that it “programmed” her to meet the man she married.</p><p>“You know, it’s funny, because Peter and I both saw (aliens) before we knew each other, doing the same thing, driving on the road with our dads. in all seriousness. We were both in junior high. A few years later, we met, and we realized that we had the same experience. I think that somehow we were programmed to meet. We both have this scar. It’s the exact same scar on the exact same spot. I said to him, that’s what the aliens programmed us to think. But really, that’s where the chip is.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that Peter Marc Jacobson believes that he saw aliens as a kid, it would be easy to assume that he also thinks he was programmed to meet the woman he married. As it turns out, however, Jacobson doesn’t buy into Fran Drescher’s theory. Instead, he believes that Drescher’s got the scar on her hand from something like spilling hot water on herself, a drill bit accident, or another mundane accident.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Pictures Of UFOs That Prove Aliens Have Been Here Since The Beginning</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=relationship-status>Relationship Status</h2><p>Of course, it should go without saying that a lot of people would roll their eyes if they learned about Fran Drescher’s alien beliefs. On the bright side, Drescher can believe whatever she wants and the opinions that random strangers hold about her alien story make no difference. After all, Drescher still believed her marriage was inspired by aliens even though it ended in divorce.</p><p>After Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson met when they were 15-years-old, they dated throughout their high school years and tied the knot after they turned 21 in 1978. After 18 years of marriage, Drescher and Jacobson suddenly announced that they were separating in 1996. While talking to People about her divorce, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drescher stated that her ex-husband had “control issues</a> that I found somewhat suffocating”. As a result, the couple would finalize their divorce in 1999.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Of The Costliest Celebrity Divorces Ever</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that Fran Drescher thought that aliens programmed her to meet Peter Marc Jacobson, it would have been understandable if her beliefs were rocked by her divorce. However, that couldn’t be further from the truth. After all, by the time Drescher talked about her alien programming beliefs to the press, she’d already been divorced for more than a decade.</p><p>While it may seem strange that Fran Drescher believes she was programmed to meet a man she eventually divorced, it actually makes a lot of sense. After all, unlike some divorced couples who grow to hate one another, Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson have a closer relationship now than at any other time in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years after Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson got divorced, he came out to his ex-wife. During the aforementioned People interview, Drescher spoke about the fact that the former couple now understands why Jacobson was so controlling in the past. “Only in hindsight, do we now understand that he was working so hard to control his authentic self, his true orientation.” That revelation allowed Drescher and Jacobson to build a relationship as extremely close friends which remains solid to this day. With that in mind, it makes sense that Drescher was able to believe she was programmed to have Jacobson in her life.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> 'The Nanny' Was Supposed To Be Italian.
