The satirical comedy bested Oppenheimer nearly twice-over.</p><p>The movie centers on Barbie and Ken as they leave the safety of Barbie World following an existential crisis — “Do you ever think about dying?” Barbie asks her fellow dolls on the dance floor — and head into the unknown of the real world. It’s a film about identity, breaking barriers and questioning the boxes society places us in.</p><p>While nearly all of Tinseltown has been decked out in pink even prior to the film’s release, not everyone is on board with some of the movie’s progressive themes — and the haters have made their criticism known.</p><p>Keep scrolling for the Hollywood discourse on Barbie:</p><h3>The Stans</h3><p><a href=#><strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong></a> was <a href=#>openly “weeping”</a> while taking daughter Poppy to see the Barbie movie. The Today With Hoda & Jenna cohost praised the film for its humanistic themes, noting on Tuesday, July 25, that the movie showed “what it means to be human, what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, all of those things.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Eva Mendes</strong></a>, meanwhile, couldn’t wait to gush about Gosling as Ken, whom she called “Mi Hombre, Mi Vida, Mi Amor” in an effusive Instagram post earlier this month praising her longtime partner in the role. Mendes opted to quote Gerwig’s commentary to Rolling Stone, in which she hailed Gosling’s performance as “some combination of Marlon Brando meets Gene Wilder meets John Barrymore meets <a href=#><strong>John Travolta</strong></a>.”</p><p>Even <a href=#><strong>Amy Schumer</strong> </a>— who was initially cast as Barbie in the project before the film and its production went in a different direction — had <a href=#>nothing but good things to say about the film</a>.</p><p>“Really enjoyed Barbie and Oppenheimer but I think I should have played<a href=#><strong> Emily Blunt</strong></a>‘s role [in Oppenheimer],” she quipped via Twitter on Monday, July 24.</p><h3>The Barbie-Burning Backlash</h3><p>For all of the worldwide Barbie love, the movie was also met with drama — with some critiques more legitimate than others.</p><p>Robbie joked to<a href=#> People</a> on the day of the movie’s release that her friends were horrified that she didn’t lock lips with Gosling at any part in the film.</p><p>“All of my girlfriends were like, ‘Well you did a whole movie with him and you don’t kiss? What’s wrong with you?’ I thought you were kind of in charge on this one!’” she quipped.</p><p>Robbie’s friends’ lighthearted humor, however, was no match for men in power who derided film’s feminist themes and political undertones. <strong>Sen. Ted Cruz</strong> called the movie “propaganda,” while controversial political commentator <strong>Ben Shapiro</strong> lambasted Barbie as a “flaming garbage heap” and criticized its “woke” narrative. He also shared a YouTube video of his thoughts titled, “Ben Shapiro DESTROYS The Barbie Movie for 43 Minutes,” in which he destroyed Barbie and Ken dolls by setting them ablaze.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Celebs-React-to-Barbie-Movie-The-Stans-The-Defenders-and-The-Critics-301.jpg><h3>The Defenders</h3><p><a href=#><strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong></a>, for her part, <a href=#>was having none of it</a> when discussing Cruz and Shapiro’s commentary on The View.</p><p>“It’s a movie! It’s a movie about a doll!” Goldberg, 67, declared. “I thought y’all would be happy. [Barbie] has no genitalia, so there’s no sex involved. Ken has no genitalia, so he can’t — it’s a doll movie!”</p><p>Her View cohost <strong>Alyssa Farah Griffin</strong>, meanwhile, slammed the men for feeling “emasculated” by the movie.</p><p>Weeks after the film’s premiere, <strong>Marc Maron</strong> weighed in on the discourse via <a href=#>TikTok</a>, calling Barbie a “f–king masterpiece.” He continued in August, “I’ve never seen anything like it. … The fact that certain men took offense to the point where they, you know, tried to build a grift around it in terms of their narrative … it’s so embarrassing for them.”</p><p>Maron added: “Any dude that can’t take those hits in that movie, they’ve really got to look in their pants and decide what they’re made of. I mean, Jesus Christ, what a bunch of f–king insecure babies.”</p><h3>The Fashion, Because Pink Is the New Pink</h3><p>Forget any of the naysayers — if Barbie managed to get one thing right, it is the fashion. (And not just in the film, though it wouldn’t surprise Us if costume designer <strong>Jacqueline Durran</strong> was headed for another Oscar.) At every red carpet event promoting the movie Robbie was <a href=#>decked out in variations of actual Barbie outfits</a> through the years — and every movie-goer followed suit.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kim</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> rocked the doll’s signature color while taking their daughters and nieces to <a href=#>the World of Barbie Experience</a> in Los Angeles in early July; <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> opted for <a href=#>hot pink jorts</a> when seeing the film. Bush Hager, 41, sported a pink sweater at the movies while watching Barbie with her 7-year-old daughter, who wore Barbie shorts for the occasion.</p><p>Gerwig, for one, was in awe of the reach of the film — and its fashion. “It’s been amazing to walk around and see people in pink,” she told The New York Times. “Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine something like this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Matchbox-20-s-Rob-Thomas-Reacts-to-Push-in-Barbie-Greta-Gerwig-Explains-Ryan-Gosling-s-Cover-262.jpg><h3>The Music</h3><p>Not only is the Barbie soundtrack so stacked with talent we don’t even know where to begin — see: <a href=#><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></a> and <strong>Ice Spice</strong>‘s “Barbie World,” <a href=#><strong>Lizzo</strong></a>‘s “Pink,” <strong>Dua Lipa</strong>‘s “Dance the Night and many more — Gosling’s “I’m Just Ken” is the powerhouse performance that everyone can’t stop talking about.</p><p>“He has a beautiful voice, and he’s a beautiful dancer. We got there organically,” Gerwig told Rolling Stone on Wednesday, July 25, when explaining how she managed to get the former Mickey Mouse Club member to<a href=#> actually show off his singing chops</a> in the film. “I think if I had said, ‘I want you to sing and dance in this movie,’ he would not have necessarily done that for me. But it was kind of that thing of boiling a lobster. I think by the time he was singing and dancing, he didn’t even totally know how we had gotten there. But he’s so fabulous at it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the scene of all of the Kens singing Matchbox 20’s “Push” to the Barbies on the beach? Iconic. Even <a href=#>MB20 frontman <strong>Rob Thomas</strong> was here for it</a> — even though he thought the band would be the “butt of the joke” at first.</p><p>“I want to preface this by saying I thought it was hilarious,” the musician told USA Today, adding that Gerwig is “one of my crushes forever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmrnZGgtq%2BzjJ2msKZdqbWmeceoo6Wxp6S8pXnDoqqcp6WnwKZ50q6pq6elo7GqusZmq6GdXZeus67InmSmp6aesnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbreaking-down-the-hollywood-discourse-surrounding-the-barbie-movie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbreaking-down-the-hollywood-discourse-surrounding-the-barbie-movie.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbreaking-down-the-hollywood-discourse-surrounding-the-barbie-movie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbreaking-down-the-hollywood-discourse-surrounding-the-barbie-movie.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbreaking-down-the-hollywood-discourse-surrounding-the-barbie-movie.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbreaking-down-the-hollywood-discourse-surrounding-the-barbie-movie.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./denzel-washington-and-ethan-hawke-are-reuniting-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./denzel-washington-and-ethan-hawke-are-reuniting-html.html>Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawkes First Film Together Since Training Day Will Be a Western</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./auma-obama-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-54508-html.html>Auma Obama Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./auma-obama-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-54508-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
