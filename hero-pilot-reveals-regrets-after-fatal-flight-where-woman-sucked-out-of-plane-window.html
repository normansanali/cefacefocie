In fact, she was never supposed to be in the driver's seat, but decided to swap shifts with her pilot husband Dean so she could make it to their son's school athletics competition in Texas.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><strong>READ MORE:<br>•<a href=#>The Big Read: How the horror of Southwest Airlines flight unfolded</a><br>•<a href=#> Southwest Airlines passenger tells why Jennifer Riordan couldn't be saved</a><br>•<a href=#> Passenger next to Southwest Airlines flight victim Jennifer Riordan recalls horrific ordeal</a><br>•<a href=#> Woman who died in horror Southwest flight named as mum of two</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/q6jqgVWVYBuMr_CTgU-crVngDiA=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/HOWF6BXVYE626YIRQF7BMUJDHQ.jpg"><p>Cruising out of New York, like a crack of thunder, there was a loud bang from one side of the aircraft and suddenly, the Boeing plane rolled 41 degrees to the left.</p><p>Smoke began to fill the cabin and flight attendants rushed row by row to make sure all passengers could get oxygen from their masks that had dropped from the overhead.</p><p>As the pilots tried to remain calm and keep control of the 737, they became blinded as billowing black smoke filled the cockpit. Short of breath and sight Schults, a New Mexico native and mum-of-two, calmly called for assistance unaware of the horror unfolding in the cabin.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"We couldn't see, we couldn't breathe, and a piercing pain stabbed our ears, all while the aircraft snapped into a rapid roll and skidded hard to the left as the nose of the aircraft pitched over, initiating a dive toward the ground," Schults wrote in her new book, Nerves of Steel: How I Followed My Dreams, Earned My Wings, and Faced My Greatest Challenge, which launched this week.</p><p>Following 16 months of near-silence about the terrifying flight, Schults said in an interview with Elle to coincide with the book launch that she thought they had been "hit by another aircraft" when the plane began to plunge.</p><p>"The hit was so hard, and the jolt was so violent," she recalled.</p><p>"We heard the explosion. We could see the engine instruments blinking and winding down. Then there was this shudder. We couldn't focus our eyes on anything, and smoke spilled into the cockpit. The roar was so loud we couldn't hear our own voices. Darren and I were yelling to each other, but we used hand motions because it was so loud."</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-world">Related articles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/q6jqgVWVYBuMr_CTgU-crVngDiA=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/HOWF6BXVYE626YIRQF7BMUJDHQ.jpg"><p>The plane's left engine had exploded mid-flight, sending shrapnel flying through the air and causing a passenger's window to smash.</p><p>As flight attendants rushed row by row to make sure all passengers could get oxygen from their masks that had dropped from the overhead, a devastating scene was unfolding in row 14.</p><p>When flight attendant Rachel Fernheimer arrived, she saw 43-year-old passenger Jennifer Riordan still restrained by her belt but with her head, torso and arm hanging out a window that had been broken open by the engine explosion.</p><p>After several failed attempts to reach the pilots by intercom because of the rush of air and noise, flight attendant Seanique Mallory was finally able to relay the situation to the cockpit who had already planned an emergency landing of the crippled Boeing 737-700 in Philadelphia.</p><p>In a message to air traffic control, Schults processed what was happening in the cabin and calmly called for assistance before explaining the dire situation that was unfolding inside the plane.</p><p>"I had this burst of adrenaline that made me think so fast and remain so calm," she said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I was thinking to myself, 'I don't think everything is going to stay on this aircraft for us to land, but I'll do everything in my power to make sure we land safely'.</p><p>"After we landed, I put away my oxygen mask, collected my stuff, made sure I got my headset and shook hands with the passengers as they exited.
