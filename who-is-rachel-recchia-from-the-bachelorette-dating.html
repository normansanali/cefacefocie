After the way he treated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Lawson</a>, we sure hope not…</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>On season 19 of The Bachelorette, Rachel was the lead alongside the spunky <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabby Windey</a>. Both women thought they had found love in the end with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tino Franco</a> and Erich Schwer, however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">both Rachel and Gabby’s relationships fizzled out as soon as the show wrapped</a>.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>After getting engaged to Tino during the season 19 finale, Rachel’s then-fiancé told her that he had been unfaithful post-filming, as he had kissed another woman while they were going through a hard time in their relationship. He claimed that that moment made him realize that he wanted to be with Rachel forever and always, however, it did not garner forgiveness from the former Bachelorette.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with former Bachelorettes Michelle Young and Becca Kufrin on the Bachelor Happy Hour podcast</a>, she revealed that Tino’s story seemed to lack consistency:</p><p>“Every single time he told his story, something changed, a detail would change. First it was a kiss at a party, then it was a kiss in an Uber to her house where his car was parked, so where is the story connecting? When you’re lying, you can’t get your story straight. That’s why he was getting up multiple times to try to figure it out, but then would come back and put it on me.”</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Naturally, Rachel called off her engagement with Tino, and she has been pursuing life as a single woman. At least that’s what we think…</p><h2 id=h-who-is-rachel-recchia-from-the-bachelorette-dating data-injectable=false>Who is Rachel Recchia from ‘The Bachelorette’ dating?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>In the trailer for the forthcoming season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor in Paradise</a> (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which is set to premiere on Thursday, September 28</a>), we see four former Bachelorettes show up to the beach, ready to make a splash: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hannah Brown</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Thurston</a>, Charity Lawson, and Rachel Recchia.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>While all four of these former Bachelorettes make an appearance on the beach, it has been confirmed that only one of these stunning women is actually trying her chance at love on season 9 of Bachelor in Paradise. This individual is the one and only Rachel Recchia.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Rachel will make history as the second former lead to go to Bachelor in Paradise after her season, following in the footsteps of Becca Kufrin, who fell in love with her now-fiancé, Thomas Jacobs, during season 7.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Based on the trailer, fans of The Bachelor franchise can get a tiny glimpse into Rachel’s Bachelor in Paradise experience, as long as they keep their eyes peeled…</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=857 data-injectable=true>Within the first 40 seconds of the trailer, we see Rachel share a passionate kiss with what looks like Jordan Vandergriff, a suitor from her season of The Bachelorette. Despite the duo missing a spark when they dated last year (causing him to be sent home week two), it looks like this flame may have finally ignited on the beach. “This is crazy, getting a second chance. I think things happen for a reason,” Rachel gushed after sharing a smooch with Jordan.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>While their relationship appears to be smooth sailing, Jordan is not the only man Rachel is seen exploring a connection with on Bachelor in Paradise…</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Later on in the trailer, we see Rachel on a date with (you guessed it) Brayden Bowers, the man she was attached at the hip with during the “After the Final Rose” episode last night. “A toast to finding someone who can match my crazy,” Brayden said, prior to clinking champagne glasses with Rachel.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false><strong>Warning: the following section contains spoilers for&nbsp;season 9 of&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise.

This suitor is the one and only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanner Courtad</a>, the man who stole our hearts on Charity’s season of The Bachelorette.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a post from Reality Steve on July 18</a>, “Rachel was involved with Tanner during filming, but ultimately self-eliminated. She wasn’t eliminated at a rose ceremony.”</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Regardless of whether or not this is true, it can be inferred that Rachel leaves the beach single, despite giving a second chance at love her very best shot.
