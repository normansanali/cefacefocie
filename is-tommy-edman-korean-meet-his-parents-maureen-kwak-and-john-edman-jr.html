Edman has been playing professionally for a few years after making his MLB debut in 2019. In the sixth round of the 2016 MLB draft, he was picked by the St. Louis Cardinals. Previously, the young athlete was a member of the minor league system.</strong></p><p>The Gold Glove Award was given to the 28-year-old baseball player for being the best defensive second baseman in the National League in 2021. Edman is competing in the World Baseball Classic for Korea. Following the revelation, many people have been wondering why Tommy Edman is playing for Korea. Is the young player of Korean origin?</p><h2><span id=Tommy_Edman_is_he_Korean>Tommy Edman is he Korean?</span></h2><p>Tommy Edman is an American citizen. He will represent South Korea in the World Baseball Classic since his mother’s family is Korean. Maureen Kwak, Tommy Edman’s mother, was born in Korea. As a kid, she migrated to the United States and settled down. Furthermore, Tommy Edman’s parents greeted him in Pontiac, Michigan. He was raised in San Diego.</p><p>While Edman’s link to Korea may have surprised some, it has only strengthened the World Baseball Classic’s worldwide appeal. The World Baseball Classic eligibility requirements are quite wide. The most apparent need is to be a native of the target country. However, there are several more instances in which a player may represent a country.</p><p>For example, becoming a citizen, relocating permanently, or having a parent or grandparent born in the nation. The most basic explanation is that players may represent a country if they are eligible for citizenship in that country, but they do not have to be citizens.</p><p>Edman said Yonhap News Agency, “that’s the great part about the World Baseball Classic.” The baseball player from Michigan noted that it enables people all around the globe to watch baseball and introduces baseball to many more countries.</p><p>Tommy Edman also discussed the competition between Japan and South Korea, with which Korea would share a pool. In the future matches, Edman will meet Cardinals’ Lars Nootbaar, who is Japanese on his mother’s side.</p><h2><span id=Maureen_Kwak_and_John_Edman_Jr_are_Tommy_Edman8217s_parents>Maureen Kwak and John Edman Jr. are Tommy Edman’s parents.</span></h2><p>Tommy Edman was born on May 9, 1995, as Thoman Hyunsu Edman to parents John Edman Jr. and Maureen Kwak.His father played collegiate baseball at Williams collegiate for four years. John coaches varsity baseball at La Jolla Country Day School. He is also a teacher at the school.</p><p>Tommy has two siblings: John, his older brother, and Elise, his younger sister. His elder brother works for the Minnesota Twins in research and development. His sister, on the other hand, is a former Davidson College volleyball player. She used to be a Systems Engineer with the Cardinals.</p><h2><span id=Kristen_Edman_Tommy_Edman8217s_Wife>Kristen Edman, Tommy Edman’s Wife</span></h2><p>Kristen, the baseball player’s wife, is 28 years old. Since then, the cute couple has been together happily. The wedded couple had initially intended to marry on October 5, 2019.</p><p>However, owing to the Cardinals’ involvement in the 2019 National League Division Series, they were forced to postpone it. The pair does not seem to have any children together.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Abilio James Acosta</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Ladd Drummond</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Ryans Williams</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Baseball</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Padre Salvi In El Filibusterismo | Death Hoax Debunked</a></h3>What Happened To Padre Salvi In El Filibusterismo is a common question. as Padre, in the book El Filibusterismo, was the town curator of San Diego and Padre Damaso's successor.
