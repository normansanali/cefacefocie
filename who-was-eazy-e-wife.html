For many years, my mom and I have been fighting to know exactly what happened.”</p><p>While the We TV docuseries investigated the rap icon’s death, many fans of the N.W.A. founding member grew curious to learn more about Eazy-E’s personal life. For starters, who was his wife? Is she the mother of Ebie, who is featured in The Mysterious Death of Eazy-E? Keep reading for answers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Eazy-E was romantically involved with several different women, but only married once.</h2><p>In the docuseries, <a href=#>Ebie</a> mentions that her mother, Tracy Jernagin, and she have long been trying to get to the bottom of Eazy-E’s death. Audiences then get to hear from Tracy. “Something just did not seem right,” Eazy-E’s ex says. “He died unusually fast. He did not lose weight, he was not a drug abuser; it’s like, one day, he’s fine, the next day, he’s dying.”</p><p>Ebie and Tracy executive-produced the series along with nine others to try to find closure around Eazy-E’s death, but Tracy and the gangsta rapper were never actually married.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Eazy-E’s manager and Ruthless Records co-founder, Jerry Heller, said that the rapper was known to have “multiple girlfriends” and fathered 11 kids in his short 30-year life. “I listened to him talk to his multiple lovers on the phone, one after another,” Jerry recalls in his 2006 Ruthless, a Memoir, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>. “Women were his Achilles’ heel. I couldn’t believe that a guy with so few other weaknesses indulged himself in such a huge one.”</p><p>Following the publication of his memoir, Jerry sat back down with The Washington Post to discuss the feud between Suge Knight and Eazy-E, which many allege ties in directly to the rapper’s quick and <a href=#>untimely death</a>. In his interview, Jerry also explains that his friend “was very promiscuous.” “He had, I think, 11 children with eight different women,” Jerry said. “Two of the children, I think, [were born] after he [died].” Jerry later admitted that “no one really knows for sure how many children he had.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Eazy-E's ex-wife? She controls Ruthless Records.</h2><p>Eazy-E ultimately did marry Tomica Woods, whom he met at a nightclub in 1991, just 12 days before his death in 1995. Tomica is the mother to two of Eazy-E’s kids: son Dominick and daughter Daijah, who was born six months after his death from AIDS-induced pneumonia.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After Eazy-E passed, Ruthless Records was taken over by his widow Tomica, who then made headlines in 2017 when she sued her stepson, Eric Darnell Wright (aka Lil Eazy-E), for trademark infringement over the use of the names Ruthless Records and N.W.A.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Eric allegedly formed a corporation called NWA-LLC and tried to obtain a trademark for "Ruthless Records Inc.," which was rejected by the U.S. Patent office for being "confusingly similar" to his father's Ruthless Records.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The suit, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, also pointed out that Ruthless Records Inc. used "intentionally false and misleading" language in their promotions. For example, it accuses Eric and his partner of describing their company as "founded by legendary gangsta rap artist Eazy-E," and stating on their website that Ruthless Records Inc had "signed artists under NWA Entertainment."</p><p>In 2018, the suit was settled, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, and, Lil Eazy-E was given the rights to use "the name and mark 'Rich & Ruthless.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Eazy-E's wife die?</h2><p>Tomica has done such a good job at keeping a low profile that many people are now questioning whether the late rapper's wife had died. While there has been no report of such news, Tomica's name was brought up during a November 2023 interview with <a href=#>Suge Knight</a>. During the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nov. 19 episode</a> of the Collect Call podcast, Dave Mays spoke with the incarcerated record mogul about Tomica's role in what would have been a profitable deal between Eazy-E and Dr. Dre.</p><p>Suge claims Tomica terminated a deal between Eazy-E and Dr. Dre that would permit him to get "a dollar off of anything that Dre does or sells," be it music or merchandise. However, Tomica reportedly opted for a deal with Interscope in which the record label reportedly promised to conduct business with the widow and Ruthless Records in the future. Sadly, Suge says it never amounted into anything.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaaqmadka%2FGbrGMsKCfnQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-eazy-e-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-eazy-e-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-eazy-e-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-eazy-e-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-eazy-e-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-eazy-e-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-do-they-brush-the-ice-during-curling.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-do-they-brush-the-ice-during-curling.html>Why do they brush the ice during curling?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-nadine-ellis-husband-our-kind-of-people-actress-family-life-explored.html>Who Is Nadine Ellis Husband?
